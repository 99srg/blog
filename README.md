# Blog_automated_software_test
# A simple command line application that let users create blogs and posts.
# Unit, integration and system tests were done for this app, alongside with patching.
# In the app.py file we have our menu that:
-  Shows the user the available blogs
-  Lets the user make a choice
-  Does something with that choice
-  Eventually exits
